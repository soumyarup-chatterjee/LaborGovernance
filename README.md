In the current COVID situation, finding jobs for labourers have become extremely difficult.
This project aims to build a platform where labourers can be connected with companies and vice versa.

Considering the lack of technical know-how in one of the most important communities in a country, this project does not require a labourer to have any sort of digital connectivity. Only a basic alphanumeric phone is enough for staying updated with company offers.

Communication is achieved thorugh SMS and Interactive Voice Response (IVR) facility. On the other hand, a company would require internet capabilities for making use of the platform and hiring labourers.

In this way, a company can skip the middleman contractor and directly hire labourers. This would result for less expenditure on the part of the company and better contracts for hired labourers.
